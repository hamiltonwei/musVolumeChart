# Purpose

This document is a informal, very high level summary of what is required for the project. It will NOT contain any detailed requirement. Those will be tracked in a different document.

# Project Scope and Requirements

Here we define the scope of this project. This project is a *prototype* of the bigger "Music Data Visualizer" project. Specifically, it showcases a single visualization - the listening volume over time chart, and we will use it to explore what tools we want to use and the capability of those tools.

## In-Scope Requirements:

The requirements that are in scope for this project are:
* Presenting a working chart of your music listening activity over a period of time
* Make this chart interactive, able to respond to various user controls in an intuitive, user friendly way.
* Make this chart pretty and pleasing to the eye
* Makes this chart *moderately* creative: You don't have to go all out with the creativity on this one. A simple line chart will do.
* Allows this chart to take in real music data that spans at least 1 year and display the info.

## Out-of-scope requirements:

The requirement that are OUT OF SCOPE for this project are:
* Load real data in an efficient and user friendly way. 
    * The data are there just so that we can test the chart. Making a good back end isn't the purpose of this prototype.
* Host this project on a web server.
* Implement any backend code.
* Able to add new charts easily
    * That would be considered when we are making the real webpage or maybe with a different prototype. For this, don't bother with that. Just do one chart and do it right.
* Implement any additional user control, outside of the chart controls and some basic data loading stuffs.
